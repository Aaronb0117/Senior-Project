            <h2>Phishing</h2>
            <p>Next, let’s take a look at an attack in Cybersecurity. This attack is the most common and pushes 3.4 billion spam emails daily. (<a href="https://aag-it.com/the-latest-phishing-statistics/#:~:text=Headline%20Phishing%20Statistics,sent%20in%202022%20were%20spam.">AAG</a>) This attack is called phishing.
            Phishing is an illegal process of gaining sensitive information by mimicking a trustworthy entity. When describing this entity, it represents an organization, institution (college/university), person, etc. Phishing scams can take PII. PII stands for personally identifiable information, which means information that can identify a person. Different types of information include home addresses, social security numbers, banking information, and more.
            Phishing scams show in multiple ways. Some ways are spear phishing, whaling, voice phishing, and text phishing. For more information on the types of phishing,
            <a href="https://www.verizon.com/about/account-security/phishing">Verizon</a> has provided multiple ways with definitions you will need later.</p>

            <p>How can you protect yourself from phishing scams? Well, there are multiple techniques to protect yourself from phishing. Common ways of protecting yourself are using security software, setting automatic updates, using multi-factor authentication, and backing up data.

            Let’s break down what this means following these ways of protection. Security software protects your device from unwelcome access. You can use security software such as McAfee, Norton, and more on <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/picks/the-best-security-suites">PCMAG</a>. Another use is called multi-factor authentication. Multi-factor authentication is an extra step required after logging in. 
            Some examples are sending a code to a phone number or email, using an app to verify the account, and more on <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/mfa/#:~:text=Multi%2Dfactor%20authentication%20(MFA),question%2C%20or%20scan%20a%20fingerprint.">Amazon</a>. Make sure to consider protective measures to protect yourself and your device. </p>
