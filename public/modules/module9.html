            <h2>The Process of Wi-Fi</h2>
            <p>Let’s talk about the thing we constantly connect to. The Wi-Fi! We are going to talk about Wi-Fi Security. Before discussing Wi-Fi Security, let’s look at what Wi-Fi is. Wi-Fi stands for Wireless Fidelity. 
                Wireless Fidelity allows the creation of a wireless local area network (WLAN). (<a href="https://stl.tech/blog/wireless-fidelity-the-rundown/#:~:text=Wireless%20fidelity%20allows%20for%20the,Who%20invented%20Wi%2DFi%3F">STL</a>) 
                Local Area Network (LAN) is “a computer networking solution that connects devices in a limited area, such as a building, office, home and even campuses of adjacent buildings.” (<a href="https://www.tpx.com/learn/networking-solutions/what-is-a-local-area-network/">TPX</a>) 
                Wi-Fi is a wireless networking technology that connects computers, tablets, phones, and other devices to the Internet. (<a href="https://www.verizon.com/articles/internet-essentials/wifi-definiton/">Verizon</a> and <a href="https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/wireless/what-is-wifi.html">Cisco 1</a>) The Wi-Fi’s process must follow the IEEE 802.11 standard. 
                This “standard defines the protocols that enable communications with current Wi-Fi-enabled wireless devices, including wireless routers and wireless access points.” (<a href="https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/wireless/what-is-wifi.html">Cisco 1</a>)
                Wireless access points allow wireless devices to connect to wireless networks. The user can connect to a wireless router. 
                A wireless router is an Internet service provider product used to connect to a cable or an Internet network. (<a href="https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/wireless/what-is-wifi.html">Cisco 1</a>) Now we understand each component, we can discuss Wi-Fi Security.</p>
            
            <p>Wi-Fi Security is the “protection of devices and networks connected in a wireless environment.” (<a href="https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/wireless/what-is-wi-fi-security.html">Cisco 2</a>) With Wi-Fi security, there are four types of wireless security protocols. 
                The four types are WEP, WPA, WPA2, and WPA3. Let’s break down each type. WEP, also known as Wired Equivalent Privacy, was the first wireless security protocol to provide standard methods for network security from 1997 to 2004. 
                Then WPA, also known as Wi-Fi Protected Access, dealt with the flaws WEP presented. WPA 2 was developed in 2004, handling network security better than WPA. WPA 3 brings different changes to wireless security. (<a href="https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/wireless/what-is-wi-fi-security.html">Cisco 2</a> and <a href="https://www.securew2.com/blog/complete-guide-wi-fi-security">SecureW2</a>) 
                With these four types in mind, how can we practice Wi-Fi security? A common practice is practicing password security. Other practices you can take are verifying the correct wifi, turning off automatic connection, not shopping on public networks, using VPN, and more found on <a href="https://security.sdsu.edu/be-cyber-smart/guides/public-wifi">San Diego State University</a>’s page.
