            <h2>Social Media vs Social Networking</h2>
            <p>Today, we are going to talk about an everyday habit. Social Media! Social media has multiple websites and apps that help keep in contact with others’ loved ones. 
             Social media also creates businesses and interacts with the user’s audience. Another way of communicating is social networking. Social Networking focuses on forming and nourishing the connection between two or more people. 
             Social networking also focuses on maintaining the connection. This difference is significant because both concepts have similar functionalities.
