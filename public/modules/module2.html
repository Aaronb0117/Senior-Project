           <p>What is cyberbullying? How can someone detect it? How can I limit cyberbullying? Today, this module will go in-depth
        through these questions. Before we learn more about cyberbullying, we need to understand what bullying is.
        Bullying is “when people repeatedly and intentionally use words or actions against someone or a group of people
        to cause distress and risk to their wellbeing. These actions are usually done by people who have more influence
        or power over someone else, or who want to make someone else feel less powerful or helpless.” <a

          (Australian Human Rights Commission Bullying Definition)</a> Bullying will not tolerated in this program. If you
          are experiencing bullying, talk to someone you trust, and gain support. Remember to stand up for yourself when
          you are ready <a href="https://humanrights.gov.au/our-work/commission-general/what-you-can-do-stop-bullies-be-supportive-bystander-violence">(Australian Human Rights Commission Supportive Bystanders)</a>.
           </p> 

            <p>Now, let’s learn about cyberbullying. Cyberbullying is a type of “bullying that takes place over digital devices.” <a href="https://www.stopbullying.gov/cyberbullying/what-is-it">(Stop Bullying Cyberbullying Definition)</a>. Cyberbullying can happen on multiple platforms. 
                A few examples are social media, text messages, and emails. Common ways of cyberbullying include commenting under posts, making threats, posting something mean, posting disrespectful names, and more. <a href="https://www.stopbullying.gov/cyberbullying/cyberbullying-tactics">(Stop Bullying Tactics)</a>. 
                Some ways you can protect yourself from cyberbullying are ignoring the cyberbullying attempts, blocking the person bully, remaining off a social media platform or the platform that the victim is on, speaking to someone, and reporting cyberbullying. If you do not feel comfortable with these options, you can reach out to <a href="https://www.crisistextline.org/topics/bullying/#what-is-bullying-1">Crisis Text Line</a>.
