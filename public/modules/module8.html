            <h2>Online Gaming Security</h2>
            <p>Today, we are going to talk about gaming security. What will we talk about before going over gaming security? Let’s start with games.
                A game is “an activity or sport usually involving skill, knowledge, or chance, in which you follow fixed rules and try to win against an opponent or to solve a puzzle.” (<a href="https://www.collinsdictionary.com/us/dictionary/english/game#google_vignette">Collins</a>) A common type of gaming is video gaming. 
                A video game, “also known as a computer game, is an electronic game that can be interacted with using an input device, such as a controller, keyboard, or joystick.” (<a href="https://www.twinkl.com/teaching-wiki/video-games">Twinkl</a>) Video games are becoming more popular every day. 
                Statistics show that video game revenue possibly rising from $262 billion in 2023 to $312 billion in 2027. (<a href="https://www.collinsdictionary.com/us/dictionary/english/game#google_vignette">PWC</a>) 
                With this rise, it is critical to understand the risks and practice gaming security.</p>
            
            <p>The risks that come with video gaming are technological and social. Possible technological risks are malicious software (malware), affected gamer servers, and insecure game coding. 
                Possible social risks are social engineering, identity theft, virtual mugging, and more. (<a href="https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/gaming.pdf">CISA</a>) So, let’s talk about gaming security. Gaming Security, specifically online gaming security, focuses on the users’ protection while online gaming. 
                Some practices you can take are similar to cyber hygiene. 
                We will talk about cyber hygiene later. Other gaming security tips are choosing a safe username, practicing Internet safety, checking privacy settings, and more.
