            <h2>Passwords</h2>
            <p>Today, you will learn about password security. Before discussing, we need to understand what a password is. A password is a line of characters that pull the user’s information and gain access. <a href="https://www.techtarget.com/searchsecurity/definition/password">(TechTarget)</a>  
             Passwords are to be secure. Passwords can be called a passphrase or passcode. A passphrase uses more than one word, while a passcode uses numbers to unlock access. There are different ways of upholding secure passwords. </p>
            
            <p>One way to use secure passwords is password security. Password Security “ensures that only those who can provide a correct password in response to a prompt are given access.”<a href="https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/security/what-are-password-security-and-protection.html#~best-practices">(Cisco)</a> This route emphasizes the CIA.
             CIA means confidentiality, integrity, and availability. No, we are not talking about the Central Intelligence Agency.
             Common ways of password security are changing passwords every few months, using combinations of uppercase, lowercase, and special characters (letters), using different passwords for accounts, and safely storing passwords (<a href="https://www.pcmag.com/encyclopedia/term/password">PCMAG</a> and <a href="https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/security/what-are-password-security-and-protection.html#~best-practices">Cisco</a>).
             Each component is significant for a safer Internet environment.
