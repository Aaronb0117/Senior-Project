            <h2>What is Cyber Hygiene?</h2>
            <p>The last subject we will learn today is called cyber hygiene. So, what is Cyber Hygiene? Cyber Hygiene is “the practices and steps that users of computers and other devices take to maintain system health and improve online security.” (<a href="https://www.digitalguardian.com/blog/what-cyber-hygiene-definition-cyber-hygiene-benefits-best-practices-and-more">DigitalGuardian</a>) 
                Cyber Hygiene trains the user in good habits around cybersecurity. Cyber hygiene is sometimes compared to personal hygiene. (<a href="https://usa.kaspersky.com/resource-center/preemptive-safety/cyber-hygiene-habits">USA</a>) Common issues are data loss, security breaches, and out-of-date software. Let’s talk about the occurrence of each issue. 
                Data loss occurs when a hard drive or online cloud storage is not being backed up. Security breaches occur with modern cybersecurity threats. Out-of-date software and old security software happen when the user ignores regular updates.
</p>
            
            <p>Here are some cyber hygiene tips you can follow. You can create a checklist that regularly updates your device. When starting the checklist, the first thing you do is document the device’s IT resources. 
                New things to incorporate into your checklist are password manager, software and hardware updates, managing new installs, using a network firewall, data swiping software, and more.
