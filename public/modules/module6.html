            <h2>Malware vs. Viruses</h2>
            <p>Welcome back! We will be going over malware and viruses. Which one is the parent, and which one is the child? Well, let’s talk about malware. 
                Malware is known as malicious software. Malicious means having or showing intent to cause harm. Malware, AKA malicious software, is software created by hackers to steal data and damage/destroy computers and computer systems. 
                The malware’s process invades/corrupts the computer’s network. People have used malware for multiple purposes. Some common reasons for usage are to gain knowledge, disrupt the victim’s network, destroy the victim’s computer, and for financial gain. 
                There are seven types of malware. The types are viruses, worms, Trojan Horse, spyware, adware, ransomware, and fileless malware. I hope this answers the beginning question. Today, we are going in-depth on viruses. 
                If you want to learn more about the other types of malware, go to <a href="https://www.cisco.com/site/us/en/learn/topics/security/what-is-malware.html#jump-anchor-4">Cisco</a>.

            <p> What are viruses? A computer virus is “a type of malware that attaches itself to a program or file.” (<a href="https://www.techtarget.com/searchsecurity/definition/virus">TechTarget</a>) A virus “spreads by first infecting files or the system areas of a computer or network router's hard drive and then making copies of itself. 
                Some viruses are harmless, others may damage data files, and some may destroy files.” (<a href="https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/news/virus-basics#:~:text=A%20computer%20virus%20is%20a,and%20some%20may%20destroy%20files.">CISA</a>). There are many ways to protect the computer from viruses. A common way is installing an anti-virus from third-party vendors such as CrowdStrike, McAfee, and Norton. 
                Other common ways are regular virus scans, auto back-up data in storage (Ex. iCloud or a physical drive), and practice Internet safety. (<a href="https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/news/virus-basics#:~:text=A%20computer%20virus%20is%20a,and%20some%20may%20destroy%20files.">CISA</a>)
                Please make sure to research third-party vendors when searching for antivirus software.
