            <p><h2>Cybersecurity and Internet Safety</h2>
      <p>Cybersecurity is "the practice of protecting systems, networks, and programs from digital attacks." <a
          href="https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/security/what-is-cybersecurity.html">(Cisco)</a> Cybersecurity
        protects users, devices, businesses, and more. It is a broad term that recognizes different technologies,
        processes, and measures. Cybersecurity is a critical component of overall security and is essential for
        maintaining integrity and security. It is also a huge component of online safety. How does Cybersecurity and
        internet safety work together? </p>

      <p>Internet Safety (also known as online safety or Internet Safety) is the awareness of possible threats someone
        can encounter while engaging in online activities. <a

        Internet safety reminds the user to be safe and cautious of the possibilities of the Internet. This component is
        significant because cybersecurity focuses on the information inside of an organization. With both components
        working together, you will gain better protection. In this program, you will learn more about cybersecurity.
        This program will teach more about different types of attacks, how to detect these attacks, and how to protect
        yourself on the Internet. </p>
