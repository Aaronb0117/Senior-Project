            <h2>Breakdown of a Browser</h2>
            <p>We have a big concept to go over today. Let’s take a look at the browser. What is a browser? A browser is application software used to find, recover, and show content from the World Wide Web. (<a href="https://www.lenovo.com/us/en/glossary/browser/?orgRef=https%253A%252F%252Fwww.google.com%252F">Lenovo</a>) 
                We all have seen the World Wide Web because we typed it before. It is what we use every day. The World Wide Web, also known as the Web, is a collection of different websites globally. 
                These websites contain different information shared through servers and computers. (<a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/world-wide-web-www/">GeeksforGeeks</a>) Now, what is a web browser? A web browser is a software or application used to search and find websites within the Web. (<a href="https://edu.gcfglobal.org/en/internetbasics/using-a-web-browser/1/">GCF</a>)
                Web browser examples are Google, Microsoft Edge, Mozilla Firefox, and more. With information everywhere constantly, it is essential to recognize the importance of following safe browsing and browsers.
</p>
            <p>So, what is a “safe” browser? A safe browser is “a web browser with extra security measures that help prevent unauthorized third-party activity while you're surfing the web.” (<a href="https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/safe-browser.html">McAfee</a>) A third-party activity example is cookies. When describing cookies, it is not the dessert. It’s data stored by the browser on the user’s computer. 
                To avoid any third-party activities, Google created a safe browsing mode used as a safe browsing habit. Safe browsing mode allows users security from multiple types of unsafe sites and applications. (<a href="https://safebrowsing.google.com/">Google</a>) To avoid these issues, here are some safe browsing habits to start. 
                Some habits include keeping the software up-to-date, ignoring ads, reporting cyber crimes, following the golden rule, and more on <a href="https://tech.wayne.edu/news/practice-safe-browsing-habits-every-day-20659">Wayne State University</a>’s page.</p>
